This responstory contains the source code and the report for my Master thesis **"Estimate the Performance of Different Approaches
for Different Deep Neural Network Compressing Methods on Embedded System"**.

I trained two Deep Neural Network, one is Alexnet, one is Pilotnet. 
And I apply two model compression methods for each Deep Neural Network (DNN) model:
one is **Singular-Value Decomposition (SVD)** decomposition, one is **Dropout**. 
Also, there is two approach for applying SVD decomposition methods, I estimate two approaches of SVD decomposition for each network
on *Raspberry Pi 3*, meanwhile, estimate one approach of dropout for each network on *Raspberry Pi 3*.
