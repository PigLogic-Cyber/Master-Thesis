This responstory contains the source code and the report for my Master thesis **"Estimate the Performance of Different Approaches
for Different Deep Neural Network Compressing Methods on Embedded System"**.

I trained two Deep Neural Network, one is Alexnet, one is Pilotnet. 
And I apply two model compression methods for each Deep Neural Network (DNN) modelï¼š
one is Singular-value decomposition (SVD) decomposition
one is dropout. 
Also, there is two approach for applying SVD decomposition methods, I estimate two approach of SVD decomposition for each network
on Raspberry Pi 3, but I only estimate one approach of dropout for each network on Raspberry Pi 3.
